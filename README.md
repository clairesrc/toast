Extremely cursed PVP multiplayer RPG engine written in Go, Typescript with Websockets. Mostly just a toy for me to use as a sandbox and figure out how common game mechanics are implemented.

Combat mechanics include movement (arrow keys), attack (spacebar), dodgeroll (ctrl), health bar, stamina. A rudimentary player collision system prevents from moving into other players.

## Usage
Start locally:

```bash
docker compose up --build --force-recreate -d
```

Then open: http://localhost:4000 in browser
